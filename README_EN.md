## 📝 Project Introduction

QBin focuses on "fast, secure, and lightweight" online editing and content sharing, suitable for personal notes, temporary storage, team collaboration, cross-platform sharing, and many other scenarios.
- Frontend uses pure HTML+JS+CSS without heavy frameworks, featuring Monaco code editor, Cherry Markdown renderer, and a universal editor for various content types.
- Backend uses Deno Oak framework + PostgreSQL database, combined with Deno KV and Edge Cache for multi-level caching, providing excellent performance for both reading and writing.
- Built-in PWA and IndexedDB support lets you edit, save, and preview even when offline.
- Freely set access paths, passwords, and expiration dates for flexible sharing while protecting privacy.
- Compared to traditional PasteBin services, QBin offers richer editing capabilities, multi-layered security, and higher extensibility.
